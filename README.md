=====
Central Execution Bus UNIX System Utility Supervisor.
    
Cebus Artificial Intelligence system; cebus is a ai utility supervisor for computing clouds.

Welcome to the central execution background unit system bus 
unix supervisor; central artificial intelligence actor system.
or cebus for short, this software have a funny name, don't you think?
it sounds all like nonsense but have strong powerful magics!
lets see what this is all about.

A Cohort is the basic tactical ORG system.

A computing cohort have the power of 480 cores; a cohort consist of
six centurias of 80 units used to follow campaings with defined goals 
and strategies to achive those goals using strategies and analogies.

cores can also be virtual cpu's or cloud computing units.
cebus works with a default set of 10 cohorts maximum per cloud.
that settings can be changed at will but in cloud computing we're trying 
to define some internal vocabulary in where a cebus cloud is always
a system with 4800 cpu's max, two clouds 9600 units, etc.

Strategy and tactics
--------------------

0 Setting a goal
1 Strategy for achieving a goal
2 Analogy

autonomous units that can be cloned, distributed and replaced at will.

require systems to manage their own configuration, healing, 
provisioning and migration dont make slaves out of humans
if he can't fix by it self you can't fix it.

ORG Paradigm
-------------- 
Organization of Restricted Generality; ORGs are computer organizations but people are integral to their operation.

In the cebus implementation of an computational ORG goals and computational processing are followed and executed 
by the abstract figure of a capuchin minion monkey.
