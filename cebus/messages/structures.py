	'''

		The Legion comprised ten cohorts, known simply as "the first cohort", "the second cohort" etc. 
		The first cohort was considered to be the most senior and prestigious, and the tenth the least.
		A cohort consisted of approximately 480 men and commanded by one man.

		It consisted of six centuriae of 80 men, each commanded by a centurion assisted by junior officers.

		The most senior centurion of the six would have commanded the entire cohort. 

		In order of seniority, the six centurions were titled 
		 	hastatus posterior, 
		 	hastatus prior, 

		 	princeps posterior,

		This followed the order of seniority in the earlier legions, where the youngest and least experienced 
		units were termed hastati, next principes, and the oldest and most experienced triarii 

		(pilus was an alternative name for triarius, the singular of triarii).
